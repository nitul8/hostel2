                        Established on 10th October 1960, Hostel No. 2 has
                        played a pivotal role in shaping the lives of countless
                        engineers who have gone on to make significant
                        contributions to the world. It is a center brimming with
                        new talents, innovative thinkers, and vibrant,

                        "A hostel is more than just a place to stay; it is a
                        vibrant tapestry of experiences, woven together by the
                        diverse lives of its residents."

                        camaraderie and connection. Hostel life is a unique
                        chapter in one's journey, where the mundane meets the
                        extraordinary, and where every day unfolds with new
                        possibilities.

                        Amidst the crisp autumn air and the golden hues of
                        falling leaves, on 10th October, a hostel was bornâ€”an
                        establishment that would go on to become a cherished
                        haven for countless travelers, students, and wanderers.
                        This hostel, though modest in its beginnings, was
                        established with a vision that transcended mere brick
                        and mortar.

                        Dr. Himandra Nath Borthakur of the Civil Engineering
                        Department was the First Superintendent of the hostel.

                        various Superintendents like Sri. Joydip Sarma and
